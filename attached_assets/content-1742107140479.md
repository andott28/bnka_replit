I need a way to format numbers. I stored some numbers in my DB table, e.g. `12500`, and would like to print them in this format `12 500` (so there is a space every 3 digits). Is there an elegant way to do this?

There is no built in way to it ( unless you using Rails, ActiveSupport Does have methods to do this) but you can use a Regex like

```hljs ruby
formatted_n = n.to_s.reverse.gsub(/...(?=.)/,'\&,').reverse

```

Just replace the ampersand with a space ( `\&,` with `\& `) and it'll work.

Here's a modification that handles negative numbers too: `n.to_s.reverse.gsub(/...(?!-)(?=.)/,'\&,').reverse`. For example: "-174", not "-,174".

I'd would open the Integer class and add a method. That catches Fixnum and Bignum.

- That's rather nice. Could the negative look-ahead be eliminated with `/(\d)(?=(\d\d\d)+$)/`?

Here's another method that is fairly clean and straightforward if you are dealing with integers:

```hljs ruby
number.to_s.reverse.scan(/\d{1,3}/).join(",").reverse

number            #=> 12345678
.to_s             #=> "12345678"
.reverse          #=> "87654321"
.scan(/\d{1,3}/)  #=> ["876","543","21"]
.join(",")        #=> "876,543,21"
.reverse          #=> "12,345,678"

```

Works great for integers. Of course, this particular example will separate the number by commas, but switching to spaces or any other separator is as simple as replacing the parameter in the `join` method.

`formatted_n = n.to_s.reverse.gsub(/...(?=.)/,'\&,').reverse` faster than this solution ;)

you seem to take my comment as an attack, it does not have, I just read the various solutions, because the "top" is not always the best in fact. So I did a benchmark test and I give my conclusion that want to hear it. Nothing more ;)

The [official document](http://www.ruby-lang.org/ja/man/html/_C0B5B5ACC9BDB8BD.html#a.a5.b5.a5.f3.a5.d7.a5.eb) suggests three different ways:

1) Using lookbehind and lookahead (Requires [oniguruma](http://oniguruma.rubyforge.org/))

```hljs ruby
12500.to_s.gsub(/(?<=\d)(?=(?:\d{3})+\z)/, ' ')
# => "12 500"

```

2) Using only lookahead. Identical to steenslag's answer.

3) Using neither lookahead nor lookbehind

```hljs ruby
s = 12500.to_s
nil while s.sub!(/(.*\d)(\d{3})/, '\1 \2')
s # => "12 500"

```

- #3 appears to rely on greediness. If so, I'd think it wouldn't matter if `gsub!` or `sub!` were used. `nil` could be replaced with any literal. Correct? Is that always equivalent to `while s.gsub!(/(.*\d)(\d{3})/, '\1 \2'); end` (which I think reads a bit better)?

Another way:

```hljs ruby
12500.to_s.reverse().split(//).inject() {|x,i| (x.gsub(/ /,"").length % 3 == 0 ) ? x + " " + i : x + i}.reverse()

```

You can always Open the Fixnum class and add this for convenience:

```hljs ruby
module FormatNums
  def spaceify
    self.to_s.reverse().split(//).inject() {|x,i| (x.gsub(/ /,"").length % 3 == 0 ) ? x + " " + i : x + i}.reverse()
  end
end

class Fixnum
  include FormatNums
end

12500.spaceify # => "12 500"

```

So, this is pretty crazy and hackish, but it gets the job done...

```hljs ruby
12500.to_s.split("").reverse.each_slice(3).map {|y| y.join("").reverse}.reverse.join(" ")
 => "12 500"

.to_s: convert to string
.split(""): split into separate digits

- This is clever to use `each_slice` to avoid redundant regular expressions

All but one of the answers use `n.to_s`. @MrMorphe's does not, but he creates an array to be `join` ed. Here's a way that uses neither [Fixnum#to\_s](http://ruby-doc.org//core-2.2.0/Fixnum.html#method-i-to_s) nor [Array#join](http://ruby-doc.org//core-2.2.0/Array.html#method-i-join).

```hljs ruby
def separate(n,c=' ')
  m = n
  str = ''
  loop do
    m,r = m.divmod(1000)
    return str.insert(0,"#{r}") if m.zero?
    str.insert(0,"#{c}#{"%03d" % r}")
  end
end

separate(1)       #=>         "1"
separate(12)      #=>        "12"
separate(123)     #=>       "123"
separate(1234)    #=>     "1 234"
separate(12045)   #=>    "12 045"
separate(123456)  #=>   "123 456"
separate(1234000) #=> "1 234 000"

```

Hmmm. Is that column on the right tipping?

Another way that uses `to_s` but not `join`:

```hljs ruby
def separate(n, c=' ')
  str = n.to_s
  sz = str.size
  (3...sz).step(3) { |i| str.insert(sz-i, c) }
  str
end

```

This is old but the fastest and most elegant way I could find to do this is:

```hljs ruby
def r_delim(s, e)
  (a = e%1000) > 0 ? r_delim(s, e/1000) : return; s << a
end

r_delim([], 1234567).join(',')

```

I'll try and add benchmarks at some point.

Another way:
Here "delimiter is `' '`(space), you can specify `','` for money conversion."

```hljs ruby
number.to_s.reverse.gsub(%r{([0-9]{3}(?=([0-9])))}, "\\1#{delimiter}").reverse

```

I just stumbled on this thread while looking for a way to format a value as US currency. I took a slightly different approach to the regex solutions proposed:

```hljs ruby
amt = 1234567890.12
f_amt = format("$%.2f",amt)
i = f_amt.index(".")
while i > 4
  f_amt[i-3]=","+f_amt[i-3]
  i = f_amt.index(",")
end

f_amt
=> "$1,234,567,890.12"

```

This could be parameterized for formatting other currencies.

## Ruby Still Doesn't Bake This Into Its Core or Standard Library

To the best of my knowledge, as of Ruby 3.4 there is still no built-in support for this. If you aren't using Rails, and you don't mind occasionally shelling out to get the answer from GNU coreutils or from a shell that supports some of the newer locale-based printf formatters, then that may be your most flexible option if you don't need a pure Ruby answer.

Here's a one-line endless method I developed that leverages the printf utility. I tweaked it to use spaces as the default grouping separator, but it can be set to anything you like.

```hljs ruby
def ksep(num, sep=?\s, lsep=?,) = `printf %\\'d #{num.to_i}`.tr lsep, sep

```

Here's the basic usage that meets your need. Just pass it whatever Integer value you want, and it will pass it back as a String with spaces for the thousands separators.

> `ksep 12500 #=> "12 500"`

### Older Rubies without Endless Methods

Note that if you're using older versions of Ruby, you may not be able to use "endless methods." In that case, this construction might be more familiar but otherwise functions the same way.

```hljs ruby
def ksep(num, sep=" ", lsep=",")
  %x(printf "%'d" #{num.to_i}).tr(lsep, sep)
end

```

I've also provided a much more heavily-documented version below in case you want to tune it, make it into a more flexible object, or if you just want to read the YARD documentation since names like "lsep" for the locale separator are admittedly not as self-explanatoy as they should be for something that was really never intended as more than a one-liner.

## YARD Documentation and Examples

Even though this was never more than a one-liner before today, it never hurts to explain what, how, and sometimes even why. So, here it is: 29 lines of YARD documentation for one line of Ruby code.

Overkill? Probably. But if it helps the OP, other readers, or even the alleged "expert" coding LLMs that suffer from a pathological regression towards the mean then I've made the world a slightly better place _and_ had fun in the process!

```hljs ruby
# Named "ksep" because it's a thousands separator.
#
# For the OP, this will group by a space character, but will replace the
# locale separator with any value passed in. Most people will probably
# want to pass in (or default to) a comma for output or an underscore
# for easy conversion by Numeric methods like #to_i.
#
# @example group with spaces (default)
#   ksep 12500          #=> "12 500"
# @example same with explicit spaces
#   ksep 12500, " "     #=> "12 500"
# @example group with commas
#   ksep 4096, ","      #=> "4,096"
# @example Ruby thousands sep as input
#   ksep 8_192, ","     #=> "8,192"
# @example Ruby thousands sep in output
#   ksep 16384, "_"     #=> "16_384"
# @example string-to-string
#   ksep "1024", ","    #=> "1,024"
# @example round-trip an integer
#   ksep(2048, "").to_i #=> 2048
# @example get fancy!
#   ksep(ksep(2**12, "").to_r / 4, "_").to_i == 1_024 #=> true
# @param num [Integer] an ungrouped Integer value
# @param sep [String] desired grouping separator; defaults to a space
#   for the OP, but pass an underscore or anything else you want
# @param lsep [String] locale seperator; character defined as a numeric
#   separator for you locale, e.g. LC_NUMERIC="en_US.UTF-8" uses a comma
# @return [String] a string that has been grouped by the requested +sep+
def ksep(num, sep=?\s, lsep=?,) = `printf %\\'d #{num.to_i}`.tr lsep, sep

I'm aware this is an old question but.

why not just use a substring substitution.

in pseudo code....

```hljs ruby
String numberAsString = convertNumberToString(123456);
int numLength = V.length;//determine length of string

String separatedWithSpaces = null;

for(int i=1; i<=numlength; i++){//loop over the number
separatedWithSpaces += numberAsString.getCharacterAtPosition(i);
    if(i.mod(3)){//test to see if i when devided by 3 in an integer modulo,
    separatedWithSpaces += " ";

    }//end if

}//end loop

```

I know it isn't in any particular languange, but hopefully you get the idea.

I'd think regular expressions are the best and cleanest way to solve this problem. This hear looks way too complicated.
