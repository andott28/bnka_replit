Okay, let's break down the logic for formatting numbers with spaces (e.g., "1000" to "1 000") in the input fields, along with best practices for implementation and considerations for correct functionality.

Core Logic:

The core of the formatting logic relies on using regular expressions to insert spaces at specific intervals within the number string. Here's how it works:

formatNumber(number) Function:

Input: Takes a number (or a string that can be converted to a number) as input.
Conversion to String: Converts the number to a string using number.toString().
Regular Expression: Applies the regular expression /\B(?=(\d{3})+(?!\d))/g to the string. Let's dissect this regex:
\B: Matches a position that is not at a word boundary. This is important to avoid adding spaces at the beginning or end of the string.
(?=(\d{3})+(?!\d)): This is a positive lookahead assertion. It checks if the following pattern exists without actually consuming the characters.
(\d{3})+: Matches one or more occurrences of three digits (\d{3}). This is the core of the grouping logic.
(?!\d): Negative lookahead assertion. It asserts that the match is not followed by another digit. This prevents adding a space before the last group of digits if it's not a full group of three.
/g: The global flag ensures that the regex is applied to all possible matches in the string, not just the first one.
Replacement: Replaces the matched positions (the non-word boundaries that satisfy the lookahead) with a space character " ".
Output: Returns the formatted string with spaces inserted at the correct positions.
removeSpaces(numberString) Function:

Input: Takes a string that may contain spaces.
Regular Expression: Applies the regular expression /\s/g to the string.
\s: Matches any whitespace character (including spaces, tabs, newlines, etc.).
/g: The global flag ensures that all whitespace characters are replaced.
Replacement: Replaces all whitespace characters with an empty string ''.
Output: Returns the string with all spaces removed.
Implementation Steps:

Import Functions: Make sure both functions are available in your component.
handleInputChange Function:
Get the input value and name from the event.
If the input is monthlyIncome, globalIncome, or debt:
Remove existing spaces from the value using removeSpaces().
Validate that the value is a number or an empty string. If not, return early to prevent non-numeric input.
Format the number with spaces using formatNumber().
Update the form data with the formatted value.
handleSubmit Function:
Before sending the data to the backend, remove spaces from the monthlyIncome, globalIncome, and debt fields using removeSpaces().
Convert the cleaned values to numbers using parseFloat() or Number().
Code Example (Illustrative):


const handleInputChange = (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
  const { name, value } = e.target;
  let formattedValue = value;

  if (name === 'monthlyIncome' || name === 'globalIncome' || name === 'debt') {
    const rawValue = removeSpaces(value);
    if (!isNaN(Number(rawValue)) || rawValue === '') {
      formattedValue = formatNumber(rawValue);
    } else {
      return; // Prevent non-numeric input
    }
  }

  setFormData(prev => ({ ...prev, [name]: formattedValue }));
};

const handleSubmit = async () => {
  const payload = {
    ...formData,
    monthlyIncome: parseFloat(removeSpaces(formData.monthlyIncome)) || 0,
    globalIncome: parseFloat(removeSpaces(formData.globalIncome)) || 0,
    debt: parseFloat(removeSpaces(formData.debt)) || 0,
  };
  // ... rest of the submit logic
};
Important Considerations:

Input Type: Use type="text" for the input fields, not type="number". This allows you to control the formatting of the displayed value.
Validation: Always validate the raw numeric value before submitting it to the backend. This prevents invalid data from being stored in the database.
User Experience: Consider providing visual cues to the user about the expected format (e.g., placeholder text).
Accessibility: Ensure that the formatting does not interfere with screen readers or other assistive technologies.
Backend Compatibility: Make sure that the backend can handle the raw numeric values without spaces.
Currency Symbols: If you need to display currency symbols (e.g., "NOK"), add them separately outside the input field to avoid interfering with the formatting logic.
Localization: The regular expression used for formatting is specific to the Norwegian locale (grouping every three digits). If you need to support other locales, you will need to adjust the regular expression accordingly.
State Management: If you are using a state management library like Redux or Zustand, make sure to update the state with the formatted value and send the raw value to the backend.
By following these steps and considerations, you can implement a robust and user-friendly number formatting solution for your input fields.
